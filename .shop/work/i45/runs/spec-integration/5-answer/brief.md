Question: Q1 (r59 against r60): r59 leaves a capability's general failure line out of the check, but r60's trigger does not. Lines: added [r59] **When** a round of the kind `integrate` has drafted its lines, `initiative-round` shall check them against the lines of `spec/` for overlapping triggers, conflicting responses and catch-all triggers other than a capability's general failure line before the gate round starts.; added [r60] **When** a round of the kind `integrate` finds a drafted line whose trigger overlaps, whose response conflicts with, or whose trigger catches all of a line of `spec/`, `initiative-round` shall give the finding, naming both lines' ids, in its result and in the gate's questions. A (recommended): replace r60 by "**When** a round of the kind `integrate` finds a drafted line whose trigger overlaps, whose response conflicts with, or whose trigger catches all of a line of `spec/` other than a capability's general failure line, `initiative-round` shall give the finding, naming both lines' ids, in its result and in the gate's questions." B: r60 as drafted, read as giving only what r59's check finds.
Delegation: The person, 2026-10-28: "i am delegating to you" and "I take recommendations"; 2026-10-29: answer every question with its recommended reading; questions of a glossary-proposal are the person's.

Read (paths in your worktree):
Run directory: /home/vscode/shopsystem-bdd/.shop/worktrees/spec-integration-5-answer/.shop/scratch/5-answer
Result file: /home/vscode/shopsystem-bdd/.shop/worktrees/spec-integration-5-answer/.shop/scratch/5-answer/result.json

You start in your worktree, /home/vscode/shopsystem-bdd/.shop/worktrees/spec-integration-5-answer: run every command from there, as it is, and never change directory (no `cd`, no `git -C`); a command that does is refused.

Write the result file first, with the outcome `PARTIAL`, and keep it current as you work: JSON with `status`, `summary` (under fifteen lines) and `questions` (a list of strings). When the delegation covers the question, give `DONE` with `answer`, the answer as one line; otherwise give `DONE` with no `answer`.
