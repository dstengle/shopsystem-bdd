# integrate of i54

Initiative: .shop/work/i54/initiative.md
Agent: initiative-round
Scripts: /home/vscode/shopsystem-bdd/scripts
Kind: integrate
Request: q20
Accepted lines of the request:
- 1. **When** `work show <request>` is run, `work` shall print the request's status, whose turn it is, its lines with their line outcomes, its questions, its answers and its resolution.
- 2. **When** `work list` is run, `work` shall print each initiative and each work-item under `.shop/work/` with its status.
- 3. **When** a round of the kind `integrate` started for a capability-proposal ends with a change list that names another capability for which the initiative holds a capability-proposal, `work run` shall add the round's ids for that capability to that proposal's `adds`, `changes` and `removes`, keeping the ids it holds.

Give your change list in your result's `changes`: a list with one entry for each capability, each `{"capability": <name>, "adds": [...], "changes": [...], "removes": [...]}`, the ids as `<capability>#r<n>`. Every term you add, change or remove goes in one entry for the glossary, `{"glossary": true, "adds": [...], "changes": [...], "removes": [...]}`, the ids as `term/<term>`, and in no capability's entry.

Worktree: /tmp/work-run-i54-249ng9qn/i54-1-integrate
Branch: round/i54-1-integrate

Read (paths in your worktree):
- .shop/work/i54/initiative.md

Run directory: /tmp/work-run-i54-249ng9qn/i54-1-integrate/.shop/scratch/1-integrate
Result file: /tmp/work-run-i54-249ng9qn/i54-1-integrate/.shop/scratch/1-integrate/result.json

You start in your worktree, /tmp/work-run-i54-249ng9qn/i54-1-integrate: run every command from there, as it is, and never change directory (no `cd`, no `git -C`); a command that does is refused.

Write the result file first, with the outcome `PARTIAL`, and keep it current as you work: JSON with `status`, `summary` (under fifteen lines) and `questions` (a list of strings), so that a session that stops part-way still leaves a result, and one that does not claim the work done. Write your notes, plan, report or findings in the run directory.
